      <h2 class = "sub-header">About</h2>
      <h3 class = "paragraph">EElizabeth Grzyb is an undergraduate senior at American University in Washington, DC, working towards her BS in Audio Technology and a minor in Applied Physics. With a foundation in audio, in computer science, and physics, she has a strong interest and background in acoustics, particularly for the built environment. She has worked as a live sound engineer for music venues and companies across the DC area, including Songbyrd Music House and Sofar Sounds. This work in live sound has only furthered her interest in architectural acoustics and sparked her interest in the way a space can sonically impact the people within them.  Upon graduation, she plans to pursue graduate study to research spatial audio technologies and their applications in architectural acoustics. She hopes to pursue a career as an acoustic consultant and apply both her knowledge of acoustics and spatial audio to contribute to architectural projects.
